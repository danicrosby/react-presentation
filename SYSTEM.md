  * Separation of concerns - That still all heavily rely on each other
    * Product
    * A11y (Accessibility)
    * Design
    * Presentation - Front of the FE Stack
    * Functionality - Middle of the FE Stack
    * Helpers - for interaction with the API - Back of the FE Stack
* How will the system leverage design and code patterns that will make it scalable and maintainable?
* Reusability where and when possible
  * Interacting with the API
  * UI Style Element
  * UI Functionality
* Testing (Manual and Automated)
